A - n8n Automation

An intelligent AI-powered email automation system built with n8n.
This workflow automatically detects new content or updates from any connected website or database, matches them with relevant users based on interests or preferences, and sends personalized email notifications using semantic AI.

🎯 Overview

The AI Email Automation Workflow streamlines communication by automatically sending personalized emails whenever new opportunities, posts, or updates are added to a website.
It connects directly to your database, uses AI embeddings for semantic understanding, and ensures that each user receives only relevant notifications.
